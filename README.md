# Hand Tracking Nareme

I made a Hand Tracking project with A-Frame using as a base the example handtracking project from A-Frame

**I made some changes in the project, I added a function which allows you to grab the selected figure, and 
I also added a Change Color button, which as it says, it changes de figure color in a random order between 
5 different colors (blue, yellow, green, orange and red) also changed the colors of the buttons to make it more original**

Below, I let you a screenshot of how the project looks like:
